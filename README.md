Shutdown [Fastify](https://github.com/fastify/fastify) graceful asynchronously. By default the fastify `close` hook is called when `SIGINT` or `SIGTERM` was triggered.

## Features

- Graceful and debug friendly shutdown
- Two-phase shutdown: pre-close handlers (before drain) and on-close handlers (after drain)
- Flush the fastify logger before process exit to avoid losing logs
- Handlers are called in parallel for faster shutdown

## Install

```bash
npm install --save fastify-graceful-shutdown
```

## Register plugin

```js
fastify.register(require('fastify-graceful-shutdown'))
```

## Usage

The plugin provides two decorators for registering shutdown handlers that run at different phases:

### `gracefulShutdown` — Immediate signal handler

Runs **immediately** when a shutdown signal (`SIGINT`/`SIGTERM`) is received, before `fastify.close()` is called. At this point the server is still fully operational — it is still accepting new connections and actively processing requests. Use this for actions that should happen before the server starts rejecting requests with 503, such as deregistering from a load balancer or service discovery, stopping message queue consumers, or flipping a health check to unhealthy.

```js
fastify.after(() => {
  fastify.gracefulShutdown(async (signal) => {
    fastify.log.info('Received signal to shutdown: %s', signal)
    await deregisterFromLoadBalancer()
  })
})
```

### `afterGracefulShutdown` — On-close handler

Runs **during** the `onClose` lifecycle, after the server has stopped accepting new connections and all in-flight requests have been drained. Use this for cleanup that is only safe once no more requests are being processed, such as closing database connections, disconnecting from Redis, or flushing buffers.

```js
fastify.after(() => {
  fastify.afterGracefulShutdown(async (signal) => {
    fastify.log.info('Received signal to shutdown: %s', signal)
    await db.close()
  })
})
```

### Shutdown order

When a signal is received, the shutdown proceeds in this order:

1. Signal received (`SIGINT`/`SIGTERM`)
2. **Immediate handlers** (`gracefulShutdown`) run in parallel — server is still fully operational
3. `fastify.close()` is called — new requests get 503, in-flight requests are drained
4. **On-close handlers** (`afterGracefulShutdown`) run during the `onClose` lifecycle — all requests are done
5. Process exits

## Compatibility

Fastify >=5

## Caveats

- Don't register signal handlers otherwise except with this plugin.
- Can't be used with a different logger other than [Pino](https://github.com/pinojs/pino) because we use the child logger feature to encapsulate the logs.
- The process will be exited after a certain timeout (Default 10 seconds) to protect against stuck process.
